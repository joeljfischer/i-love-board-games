<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey there! 👋🏼 Welcome to I Love Board Games. I'm Joel Fischer, the founder and (currently) the sole contributor. My day job is a software engineer, and I also make <a target="_blank" href="https://rainyskies.app">some other stuff</a> in my free time.</p>

<p>There's not much else you need to know (if you even really needed to know that much), but here's a bit more info about me. I started in the board gaming hobby as a child, and though I wasn't aware of the larger gaming hobby, I played games like Axis & Allies and Betrayal at House on the Hill (and your run-of-the-mill Hasbro games, but we won't talk about that 🙃).</p>

<p>I re-entered the hobby in my 20s, mostly through social deduction games, then gateway games like Ticket to Ride and Pandemic, and then into a variety of hobby games from there.</p>

<h3>Contact Me</h3>
<p>If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach out at: hello@iloveboard.games</p>

<p>I do have a family though, so I may not respond 😅</p>

<h3>Review Policies</h3>
<p>This site is <i>primarily</i> a review site. If I don't feel that I've played a game enough—or in enough contexts—to provide a score and I still want to provide my thoughts, the review will be labeled an "impression" and un-scored.</p>

<p>I may be willing to test prototype copies and preview games (such as Kickstarter games), but I'm only going to preview games that I'm personally excited about. I only cover games that I actually have played a physical copy of, and I won't cover a game that I can only play digitally.</p>

<p>I do not accept money in exchange for previewing / reviewing a game, but I'm willing to receive a finished (or in some cases, prototype) copy of a game or games. I do not promise to play the game or provide a post for it. My reviews are always my own thoughts and I do my absolute best to be unbiased in my opinions. If I have any ties to a game or company, or if I receive a game for free, I will provide such a note in the post covering the game.</p>

<h3>Comment Policy</h3>
<p>Please be kind in comments. Don't make me turn them off, please. If you disagree with me, explain why, and never attack my, or anyone else's person or character for my, or their, opinions. That said, I love to hear why people love the games they do, even (and especially) when we disagree.</p>

<p>See y'all on the site,<br/>
Joel</p>
